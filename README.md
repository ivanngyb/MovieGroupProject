The tag "stars-graph-demo-tag" is a version where Caspian wrote some code during sprint 3 to show use of the database fields for showing star ratings, not for the final version as that page was in the middle of being rewritten. https://github.com/cjmaclean/MovieGroupProject/tree/stars-graph-demo-tag
